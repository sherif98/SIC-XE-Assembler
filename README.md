C++ SIC/XE ASSEMBLER
====================

SIC stands for Simplified Instructional Computer (the XE stands for Extra Equipment) is a hypothetical architecture that was used by Leland Beck in his book 'System Software' to explain the concepts of assemblers, compilers and operating systems. [read more on wikipedia...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIC/XE)

This is a two pass assembler to convert the sic/xe instructions into object code that can be run with different SIC simulators like: [http://jurem.github.io/SicTools/](http://jurem.github.io/SicTools/).

This project was made by this team for System Programming course (CS 372) in Computer Engineering Department - Alexandria University
